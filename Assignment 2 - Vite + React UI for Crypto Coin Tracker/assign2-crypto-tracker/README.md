## Introduction

Crypto Coin Tracker is a project that tracks the data of certain crypto coins. This project is part 2 of an assignment, where part 1 only included the HTML and CSS of the project, part 2 is now the react implementation of the assignment. This part of the assignment does not include any backend development.

## Features

- Users can view individual crypto coin cards that contain data on crypto cards. Data such as: Ticker symbol, current price, market cap, 24th volume, and 24th change
- Users can search the name of crypto coins.
- Users can sort coins using the dropdown menu.
- Users can add a crypto coin to their watch list by clicking the heart icon, on a crypto coin card

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript
- HTML
